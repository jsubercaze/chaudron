# Chaudron Dataset

This it the github repository from the [Chaudron Project](http://w3id.org/chaudron/). 

Chaudron is a dataset of more than two million triples that complements DBpedia with physical measures. The triples are automatically extracted from Wikipedia infoboxes using a pattern-matching and a formal grammar approaches. This dataset adds triples to the existing DBpedia resources. It includes measure on various resources such as chemical elements, railway, people places, aircrafts, dams and many other types of resources. By the broadness of its scope, Chaudron find its place near the core of the LOD cloud. Chaudron enables the development of applications in many fields (chemistry, physics, engineering) and since it favors precision over recall it is especially suitable for Question Answering Systems. The quality of the dataset will foster the adoption of Semantic Web technologies as well as the usage of DBpedia.
